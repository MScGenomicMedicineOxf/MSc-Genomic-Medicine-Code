**This repository contains the scripts used to conduct the bioinformatic analysis portion of my research porject for my MSc in Genomic Medicine**

There are three scripts within the repository:

** 1. Global Line1 Methylation in cfDNA of HCC patients** : The code performs comprehensive analysis and visualization of LINE-1 methylation data in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) by loading and preparing data, processing methylation counts, importing metadata, and generating descriptive statistics and visualizations including PCA, box plots, and heatmaps. It also conducts differential methylation analysis using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test, plots p-value distributions, filters significant results, and saves these results for further use.
